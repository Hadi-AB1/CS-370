1- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This course's main objective was to use various machine learning techniques to create artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning served as the foundational technique, but we also discussed Deep Q learning neural networks and examined other approaches to AI, such as AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. Because chatbots that can assist in writing and optimizing code are currently accessible to the general public, this field of study is revolutionizing the creation of software. We also talked about AI ethics, which is quickly taking center stage in the sector as AIs grow more sophisticated and are employed in a wider range of tasks.

2- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Essentially, engineers try new technologies in their code base or devise new ways to optimize current procedures every day. They do this by following the scientific approach of theory, trial and error, and evaluation.

3- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The most difficult thing for newcomers to this field, in my opinion, is just defining the problem. This entails accurately defining the problem's scope and determining which system components require attention. Choosing the information flow is all that remains to be done after these two steps are created. With these three components, anybody can come up with a solution for any issue.

4- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

It's challenging to provide a specific response to this controversy because I would rather not have a difficult code; or moral standards that are unduly strict or that prohibit me from offering the service that my end-user wants. In my humble view, being honest remains the best course of action. In many ethical situations, consent makes the distinction between what is moral and what is immoral. The ethical dilemma has been addressed if it is thought to be appropriate that the final user is aware of how their information is being utilized.
